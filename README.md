## Pricing

Barebones Custom theme - $10

You send me a picture and I make theme using that picture altering the colors to make them fit the background.

I personally make a custom discord icon to fit the current theme, below is an image of the icon in question.

## Installation and Applying Themes

In order to use a custom theme you first need a discord client. I would recommend downloading [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) but something like better discord will work too.

Once you download [VencordInstaller.exe](https://github.com/Vencord/Installer/releases/latest/download/VencordInstaller.exe) from this link or the previous one go ahead and run it and click the install button in the bottom left corner.

Once discord is patched into vencord simply navigate to settings and down to the vencord section where you will find the themes tab. Click on the themes tab and paste one of the following https links into the box that says "Theme Links".

First Theme: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FacelessVagrant/Discord-Theme/master/FacelessVagrant.theme.css

Second Theme: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FacelessVagrant/Discord-Theme/master/Bjord.theme.css

Third Theme: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FacelessVagrant/Discord-Theme/master/Kirito.theme.css

Once you paste one of the links discord should automatically apply the background and that's it!
